# Test Plan

This file is a placeholder to capture how you verify the behavior of your
project and this AI control system.

Suggested sections:

1. **Control Doc Sanity**
   - [ ] `control.md` generated without errors.
   - [ ] Objective, Scope, Roles, and Deliverables sections filled.

2. **Role Generators**
   - [ ] `scripts/auto_create_role_generators.py` runs without error.
   - [ ] Each `gen_*.py` script generates a useful artifact.

3. **Schemas & Validation**
   - [ ] Sample JSON/JSONL artifacts validate against schemas via `validate_json.py`.

4. **End-to-End Flow**
   - [ ] Idea → Team & Questions → Answers → Control Doc → Generator artifacts.
