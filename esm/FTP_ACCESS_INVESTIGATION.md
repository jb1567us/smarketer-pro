# FTP Access Investigation Results

## Connection Status
✅ **Successfully connected** to ftp.elliotspencermorgan.com

## Issue Discovered
❌ **Root directory appears empty or restricted**

## Possible Causes

### 1. FTP User Jailed to Subdirectory
- Common security practice on shared hosting
- FTP user can only see their assigned directory
- WordPress files may be in a subdirectory we can't navigate to from root

### 2. WordPress.com Managed Hosting
- WordPress.com doesn't allow direct FTP file access
- Requires WordPress admin credentials instead
- Uses WordPress REST API for content management

### 3. Restricted FTP Configuration
- FTP account may have limited permissions
- May need different credentials or access method

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: WordPress Admin Access (FASTEST)
**What I need:**
- WordPress admin username
- WordPress admin password
- Or create an "Application Password" (Settings → Users → Your Profile → Application Passwords)

**What I can do:**
- Create all 149 artwork pages via WordPress REST API
- Upload optimized images directly to Media Library
- Add VisualArtwork schema to each page
- Create collection pages, Trade Portal, update About/Contact
- Set up GA4 tracking

**Time:** 30-60 minutes for full deployment

### Option 2: Hosting Control Panel Access
**What I need:**
- cPanel login (or equivalent hosting control panel)
- Or better FTP credentials with full access

**What I can do:**

---

### Option 3: Manual Import (NO ADDITIONAL ACCESS NEEDED)
**What I'll provide:**
- WordPress XML import file (already generated by tools)
- Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- Copy-paste ready code

**What you'll do:**
- Go to WordPress Admin → Tools → Import → WordPress

**Time:** 1-2 hours for you to complete manually

## Questions for You

1. **What hosting provider are you using?** (Bluehost, SiteGround, WordPress.com, other?)

2. **Do you have WordPress admin access?** If yes, I can create an Application Password for safer access.

3. **Can you access files via FTP client?** (like FileZilla) If yes, what directory do you see?

4. **Preference:** Would you rather:
   - Give me WordPress admin access for automated deployment?
   - Do manual import yourself with my detailed guide?
