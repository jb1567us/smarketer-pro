## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized)

### TODAY: Create First Artwork Page (30 minutes)

**Test the pattern with ONE page:**

1. Go to **Pages → Add New** in WordPress
2. Title: "Caviar" (or your best piece)
3. URL slug: `artwork/caviar`
4. Copy-paste the HTML template from `QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
5. Upload 1-2 images
6. Publish and test

**Why start with one?**
- Validates the approach
- Tests schema markup
- Confirms SEO structure
- Easy to adjust before scaling

### THIS WEEK: Build Core Foundation (3-4 hours)

**Priority Pages (in order):**
1. ✅ 5 artwork pages (your best/most recent pieces)
2. ✅ Update About page (add bio + CV)
3. ✅ Update Contact page (add NAP + forms)
4. ✅ Create Trade Portal page

**Why these first?**
- Immediate SEO benefit
- Establishes authority
- Captures designer leads
- Foundation for scaling

### NEXT 2 WEEKS: Expand & Optimize

**Growth Tasks:**
- Add 5-10 more artwork pages
- Create 2-3 collection pages
- Claim Google Business Profile
- Install essential plugins (Rank Math, Contact Form 7, Smush)
- Set up basic GA4 tracking

## 💡 Why Manual Approach Now?

**Automation Challenges:**
- Saatchi scraping has data quality issues (titles/descriptions not clean)
- WordPress XML import encountered technical errors
- Application Passwords not available on your hosting

**Manual Benefits:**
- ✅ Higher quality content (you control descriptions)
- ✅ Faster to first results (2-3 hours vs. days of debugging)
- ✅ Learn the pattern (easier to scale later)
- ✅ Flexibility to adjust as you go

**Automation Later:**
- Tools are ready when you want to bulk-add remaining artworks
- Can revisit after establishing the pattern manually
- Useful for adding new work over time
