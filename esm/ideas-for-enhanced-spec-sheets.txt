Below is a **designer-centric, high-value artwork information sheet blueprint**—the kind that interior designers *love* because it streamlines decision-making, reduces uncertainty, and gives them everything they need to place, spec, sell, or propose a piece to a client.

This is written in the voice of someone who knows what designers actually look for: clarity, technical precision, context, and visual aids.

# 📐 **3. Spatial Visualization Tools (Designers LOVE these)**

This is where you make your sheet *elite* and incredibly useful.

### **A. Scale Mockups**

1. Artwork shown above a sofa (84")
2. Artwork in a hallway with standard ceiling height (8’)
3. Artwork above a console table

They are the single most valuable part of a sell sheet.

* Artwork dimensions to scale
* Center point
* Hanging height marks
* Depth measurement for framed works

### **C. Color Palette Swatches**

Three versions:

* Full palette
* Primary tonal blocks
* Accent colors

Designers use this to rapidly match paint, textile, and furniture choices.

# 🧠 **4. Designer-Relevant Narrative (Not Artsy—Practical & Emotional)**

An interior designer needs to explain the piece to a client in one or two sentences.
Give them the *language*.

### **Include:**

* The artwork’s mood / emotional tone
* The story or concept in *client-friendly phrasing*
* Design pairing suggestions (materials, textures, furniture styles)
* Ideal placement within a home or commercial environment

### Example Designer Narrative

> *“This piece introduces a calm, architectural sense of movement. Its cool grays and indigo tones make it ideal for modern living rooms, executive offices, or minimalist spaces that need subtly dynamic energy.”*

This is GOLD for designers—they often reuse your wording directly.
