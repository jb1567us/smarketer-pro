# Elliot Spencer Morgan Website Audit Summary
**Date:** December 9, 2025

## Site Status: ✅ LIVE AND ACCESSIBLE

The site at [elliotspencermorgan.com](https://elliotspencermorgan.com) is fully operational with a clean, minimalist structure.

---

## Current Structure

```
elliotspencermorgan.com/
├── Portfolio (homepage) — Image grid of ~149 artworks, each linking to Saatchi Art
├── About — Brief artist statement and bio
├── Contact — Email address only
└── Buy Art — Direct link to Saatchi Art profile
```

---

## What's Working ✅

- Site is live and accessible
- Clean, professional design
- 149 artworks displayed with images
- Saatchi Art integration functional
- Basic schema markup (Person, WebSite, BreadcrumbList)

## Critical Gaps ❌

1. **No on-site artwork pages** — All links go directly to Saatchi, losing SEO authority
2. **Missing VisualArtwork schema** — Google can't establish site as authoritative source
3. **No Trade Portal** — Missing high-value designer revenue channel
4. **Minimal About content** — No CV, limited bio, few credibility signals
5. **No local SEO** — Austin market untapped (no NAP, no GBP)
6. **No collection pages** — No SEO-optimized categorization

## Top 3 Immediate Actions

### 1. Create On-Site Artwork Pages (Weeks 1-2)
Build individual pages for each artwork with:
- Full details (title, year, medium, dimensions)
- Multiple images + in-situ mockups
- VisualArtwork JSON-LD schema
- Primary CTA: "View/Purchase on Saatchi Art"
- Keeps Saatchi as checkout while claiming SEO authority

### 2. Launch Trade Portal (Week 2)
Dedicated `/trade` page with:
- Filters by size, color, style
- Downloadable spec sheets for designers
- Trade inquiry form
- Opens new high-margin revenue channel

### 3. Optimize for Austin Local SEO (Week 2)
- Claim Google Business Profile
- Add NAP to Contact page
