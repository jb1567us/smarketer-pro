Ships From: United States. Need more information? Contact us. Elliot Morgan United States View Profile I am native Austin,Texas artist and musician. I work with a pattern-oriented style using a mixed medium to translate my observation of and love for nature.   My approach to art is to free myself from the restraint and conformity of society by creating pieces that empower one's ability to \"find themselves\", respect their own unique perception and see their value in our world.  If we apply our human experience to nature, nature can help us see individual traits as infinitely important to creating symbiosis with love and respect for all life. A human ecosystem existing in harmony.
