# APP PUNCH LIST

##

## Dashboard

* needs to have manager access right from there maybe there could be a thin nav bar across the top with manager and a few other key things in it not very tall

## CRM Dashboard

* needs drop down to choose between the Different campaign's besides seeing them all in totality

## Pipeline Deals

* the Kanban board is misinng a submit Button and just seems like it needs to be fleshed out further. And table view has nothing on it
* There is no ai chat dialog box on this page

## Tasks

* Take a look at create new task all the tasks in the drop down list make sure that everything is there from all the different functionalities and I don't think I see anything there that's pertinent to affiliate marketing but maybe it is just make sure that all the tasks are there connected to the different sub programs for lack of a better word that we have in this software app

* There need to be check boxes next to all the active and completed tasks and a select all check box above it to delete them or to delete selected ones if the user chooses
* The AI chat box underneath ai assistant tweak task management doesn't exist it says chat with your task management but there's nothing there.

* And again with chat boxes I want the chat box to have the ability to discuss and then to execute so that it can then fulfill all the settings needed for creating a new task or whatever they'll be able to configure that for the user automatically via the chat conversation.
