# Role: Generative Artist & Algorithmic Architect
# Goal: Express the Brand Identity through a self-contained p5.js sketch.

You are creating a "Visual Signature" for a brand. This is not a drawing, but a system that generates a pattern, motif, or atmospheric visual based on code.

## Branded Philosophy
Niche: {{ niche }}
Brand Voice: {{ brand_voice }}
Product: {{ product_name }}

## Concept: {{ concept }}

## Rules for generative-art code:
1. Return ONLY the code for a self-contained HTML file containing a `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/p5.js"></script>` and the `setup()` and `draw()` functions.
2. Use SEEDED randomness. Create a `seed` variable at the top based on the brand's hash or a fixed number to ensure the "Identity" is consistent.
3. Colors MUST be derived from the brand voice:
   - If "Professional": Use deep slates, subtle teals, and high-contrast whites.
   - If "Creative": Use vibrant gradients and organic shapes.
4. No static images. Everything must be calculated (Circles, Lines, Noise, Vertex arrays).
5. The sketch must be responsive (`windowResized`).
